Ages after Homo sapiens abandoned an exhausted Terra, life has just begun to reclaim its place on the surface. With limited resources, sunlight, and space, spread roots and grow towards the sky to become the last plant standing.

In the world of _Flourish_, humans have abandoned Terra and life is beginning to reclaim its place on the surface. Players take on the role of a plant, attempting to grow in an environment with a scarcity of resources and a plethora of competition. Using biomass, water, and sunlight, the players must spread roots and grow towards the sun. At the same time, players must keep a watch on rival plants while balancing their own resources to prevent decay.
